## Reading data

Reading the dat.csv data file from the data folder in the project

```{r}
dat <-  read_csv("data/dat.csv")
```

## Example Bar Charts in {ggplot}
Here is a {ggplot2} example using a dataset of school mean test scores to graph a bar chart:

```{r fig7.1, fig.cap = "Figure 7.1 Example Plot"}
# create fake data
students <- tibble(school_id=c("a", "b", "c"), mean_score=c(10, 20, 30))

# create a bar chart
students %>%
  # creating a ggplot
  ggplot(aes(x=school_id, y = mean_score)) +
  # layering and specifying type of plot
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = dataedu_colors("darkblue")) +
  # applying theme_dataedu
  theme_dataedu() +
  # making all fonts in the chart size 24
  theme(text = element_text(size=24))

```

## Final Grade vs Time Spent on Course
The plot below depicts the relationship between the time spent in the course LMS (in minutes) and final course grade for the 603 online science course students in the dataset.

```{r fig7.3, fig.cap = "Figure 7.3 Final Grade vs. Time Spent with LSRL", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Scatterplot with LSRL
dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=TimeSpent, y=final_grade)) +
  geom_point(color=dataedu_colors("green")) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  theme_dataedu() +
  labs(x = "Time Spent", y = "Final Grade") +
  theme(text = element_text(size=24))

```

<br/>
## Linear Model predicting Final Grade based on Time Spent

$$
final\_grade = \beta_0 + \beta_1(TimeSpent) + \epsilon
$$

The table below summarizes the liner model to predict students' final grades from their time spent on the course.

```{r table7.1}
# fitting the linear model
m_linear <- lm(final_grade ~ TimeSpent, data = dat)

# creating a table that summarizes the linear model output
tab_model(m_linear, title = "Table 7.1")
```

<br/>
The table above showed that TimeSpent is a significant predictor of final_grade (p-value < 0.001), for every extra minute a student spend in the course their grade increases by 0.01 unit.
