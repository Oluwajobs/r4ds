## Modeling Average Data

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.


## Including Plots

### New Functions
- dplyr::mutate_at()
- readRDS()
- purrr::map and purrr::map_df()
- purrr::set_names()
- dplyr::slice()

### Tasks

In the sections that follow, we will be:

- importing data
- tidying data
- Transforming data
- Visualizing data


### Import libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

# Create student-level data
tibble(student = letters[1:10],
       school = rep(letters[11:15], 2), 
       test_score = sample(0:100, 10, replace = TRUE))
```

```{r}
# aggregates total up variables
# Create student-level data
tibble(student = letters[1:10],
       school = rep(letters[11:15], 2), 
       test_score = sample(0:100, 10, replace = TRUE)) %>% 
  # aggregate by school
  group_by(school) %>% 
  summarise(mean_score = mean(test_score))

```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(dataedu)
```


# Import Data
```{r}
race_pdf <-  
  dataedu::race_pdf
```


```{r}
race_df <- 
  race_pdf %>% 
  # Turn each page into a tibble
  map(~ as_tibble(.x, .name_repair = "unique")) %>% 
  
  # Make data frame and remove the unnecessary rows
  map_df(~ slice(., -1:-2)) %>% 
  
  # use descriptive column names
  set_names(
    c(
      "school_group",
      "school_name",
      "grade",
      "na_num",
      "na_pct", 
      "aa_num",      # African American number of students
      "aa_pct",      # African American percentage
      "as_num",      # Asian number of students
      "as_pct",      # Asian percentage
      "hi_num",      # Hispanic number of students
      "hi_pct",      # Hispanic percentage
      "wh_num",      # White number of students
      "wh_pct",      # White percentage
      "pi_pct",      # Pacific Islander percentage
      "blank_col",
      "tot"          # Total number of students
    )
  )
```


```{r}
# cleaning the data
race_df2 <- 
  race_df %>% 
  # remove unneccesary cols
  select(-c(school_group, grade, pi_pct, blank_col)) %>% 
  # Filter to get the grade-level number
  filter(str_detect(school_name, "Total"), 
         school_name != "Grand Total") %>% 
  # clean up school names
  mutate(school_name = str_replace(school_name, "Total", "")) %>% 
  # Remove white space
  mutate_if(is.character, trimws) %>% 
  # Turn percentage col into numeric and decimanl format
  mutate_at(vars(contains("pct")), list(~ as.numeric(str_replace(., "%", "")) / 100))
```



### Importing the free reduced lunch data

```{r}
frpl_pdf =  dataedu::frpl_pdf
```

```{r}
# mapping the pdf into a data frame

frpl_df <-  
  frpl_pdf %>% 
  # turn each page into a tibble
  map(~ as_tibble(.x, .name_repair = "unique")) %>% 
  # make dataframe and reduce unncessary rows
  map_df(~slice(., -1)) %>% 
  # use descriptive column names
  set_names(
    c(
      "school_name",
      "not_eligible_num",  # Number of non-eligible students,
      "reduce_num",      # Number of students receiving reduced price lunch
      "free_num",      # Number of students receiving free lunch
      "frpl_num",      # Total number of students (from the FRPL PDF)
      "frpl_pct"      # Free/reduced price lunch percentage
    )
  )
  
```

### cleaning the data further by removing empty rows and cols

```{r}
frpl_df2 <-
  frpl_df  %>%
  filter(
    # Remove blanks
    school_name != "",     # Filter out the rows in this list
    !school_name  %in%  c(
    "ELM K_08",
    "Mid Schl",
    "High Schl",
    "Alt HS",
    "Spec Ed Total",
    "Cont Alt Total",
    "Hospital Sites Total",
    "Dist Total"
    )
  ) %>%
  # Turn percentage columns into numeric and decimal format
  mutate(frpl_pct =  as.numeric(str_replace(frpl_pct, "%", "")) / 100)
```

Because we want to look at race/ethnicity data in conjunction with free/reduced
price lunch percentage,we join the two datasets by the name of the school. We want our student counts and percentages to be numeric, so apply as.numeric to multiple columns using mutate_at().

```{r}
# create full dataset joined by school name
joined_df <- 
  left_join(race_df2, frpl_df2, by = c("school_name")) %>% 
  mutate_at(2:17, as.numeric)
```

Now we move on to the fun part of creating new columns based on the merged
dataset using
mutate().

```{r}
district_merged_df <- 
  joined_df %>% 
  # Calculate high poverty numbers
  mutate(
    hi_povnum = case_when(frpl_pct > .75 ~ hi_num),
    aa_povnum = case_when(frpl_pct > .75 ~ aa_num),
    wh_povnum = case_when(frpl_pct > .75 ~ wh_num),
    as_povnum = case_when(frpl_pct > .75 ~ as_num),
    na_povnum = case_when(frpl_pct > .75 ~ na_num)
  ) %>% 
  # the adorn function creates total for each variable
  adorn_totals() %>% 
  # Create percentage by demographics
  mutate(
    hi_pct = hi_num / tot,
    aa_pct = aa_num / tot,
    wh_pct = wh_num / tot,
    as_pct = as_num / tot,
    na_pct = na_num / tot,
    frpl_pct = (free_num + reduce_num) / frpl_num,
    
    # Create percentage by demographic and poverty
    hi_povsch = hi_povnum / hi_num[which(school_name == "Total")],  # which gets the index of the Total" row
    aa_povsch = aa_povnum / aa_num[which(school_name == "Total")],
    wh_povsch = wh_povnum / wh_num[which(school_name == "Total")],
    as_povsch = as_povnum / as_num[which(school_name == "Total")],
    na_povsch = na_povnum / na_num[which(school_name == "Total")],

  )
  
```



To facilitate the creation of plots later on, we also put this data in tidy format using
pivot_longer()

```{r}
district_tidy_df <- district_merged_df %>% pivot_longer(cols = -matches("school_name"), names_to = "category", values_to = "value")
```



Discovering Distribution

```{r}
district_tidy_df %>%
# Filter for Total rows, since we want district-level information
  filter(school_name == "Total", str_detect(category, "pct"), category != "frpl_pct") %>%
# Reordering x-axis so bars appear by descending value
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(category, -value),
             y = value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", aes(fill = category)) + 
  labs(title = "Percentage of Population by Subgroup",
       x = "Subgroup", y = "Percentage of Population") +
  # Make labels more readable
  scale_x_discrete(labels = 
                     c("aa_pct"="Black",
                       "wh_pct"="White",
                       "hi_pct"="Hispanic",
                       "as_pct"="Asian",
                       "na_pct"="Native Am."
                       )) +
  # Makes labels present as percentages
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  scale_fill_dataedu() + 
  theme_dataedu() + theme(legend.position = "none")
```
